				<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a Full stack Web Developer.</p>
				<p> I have decided that it is about that time to return to my passion for web development and make it  a full-time career .  The ability to create something meaningful from mere words on a screen has always fascinated me and is why I can see myself enjoying this career path well into the future  </p>
				<p>
				 My skills as a developer  have been acquired through several programs , real world jobs, and various coding competions. Several years back I attented the original "Dev Bootcamp" where I completed a 19-week fulltime cource spending anywhere from 10 - 16 hrs a day learning various programming languages and building various apps. Following that I had a few contract positions at some small startups . In between and during these contract positions I also participated in many hackathons having won several of them - the biggest of which was FLIR's Hack the Heat competition and Docusign's Momentum Hackathon .</p>
				<p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I attended Junipero Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having to learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth it. The skills I developed learning foreign languages are find themselves usefull as I continue learning new programmming languages. </p>
